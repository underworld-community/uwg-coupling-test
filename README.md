## Method
### UW2 coupling with badlands (built in UWGedoynamics )
- Input in uw2 (see *.py file)
- [Input in badlands](https://badlands.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xml.html#) (see *.xml file)

## Test Models
- Ex1_2D L shape model
- Ex2_2D ThrustWedge (built from Tutorial 10 in UWG by Arijit Laik, Ghosh et al., 2020)
- Ex3_2D Topography relaxation model 
- Ex4_2D/3D wedge model modified from Thieulot et al., (2014)
