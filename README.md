# Coupling Model  
## Method
### UW2 coupling with badlands (built in UWGedoynamics )
- Input in uw2 (see *.py file)
- [Input in badlands](https://badlands.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xml.html#) (see *.xml file)

## Test Models
- 2D Topography relaxation model
- 2D wedge model modified from (Thieulot et al., 2014)
